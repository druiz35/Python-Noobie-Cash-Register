# Python-Noobie-Cash-Register
This is a little project I was working on a few years ago when I was a teen and I was learning Python. I did this for helping my mom with managing her cafeteria in Colombia (This is why it is in spanish). <br>
It works completly on the terminal and uses basic python libraries (json, os, datetime). <br>
To start using the cash register, you need to run on the terminal the Main.py file.
