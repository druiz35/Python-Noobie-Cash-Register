# Python-Noobie-Cash-Register
This is a little project I was working on a few years ago when I was a teen. I did this for helping my mom with managing her cafeteria in Colombia (This is why it is in spanish). <br>
It works completly on the terminal and uses basic python libraries (json, os, datetime). For using it, you just need to run on the terminal ´´´python Main.py´´´.
